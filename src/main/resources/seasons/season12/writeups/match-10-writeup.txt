BeDazzled Brothers,

After a season which promised so much, we were left on the final day hoping for results to go our way just to hold onto a 3rd place finish, which had seemed would be the very least we would get following such a strong start to the season. After 3 straight defeats, Shillelagh had overtaken us on goal difference, meaning that we were realistically relying on them dropping points for us to go back ahead into 3rd. The omens weren't immediately good - the final game of the season tends to be the silly season, as teams largely know where they're going to finish, and if promotion/relegation/league title aren't up for grabs for a team, you often see them turning up with 3 men or even not at all. And lo and behold, already promoted Nomads (who with a full team were a formidable opponent) were appealing for players earlier on in the day as they only had 4.

So, imagine my surprise when I arrived at the pitch for our game to be told that Nomads had managed to pull in some decent ringers and Shillelagh were playing like absolute tools, giving a score at half time of 7-0 Nomads. Very little changed in the second half, so the bit we had no control over had gone in our favour, and it was up to us to keep up our side of the bargain.

We had a slightly amended squad for the game from the previous week's disaster, with Dean reverting back to be between the sticks, Max returning, Chris dropping out through injury, and of the 2 who were struggling to make it, Lou DID make it, and Ross couldn't. And we were also boosted by being able to call on Jason who answered an appeal to play on the day, who has played many times for the Dazzlers over the last 10 years, and even turned out for the BeDazzled once or twice in the past. 6 strong players. Special Knees had 3, but roped in a couple of Nomads players - this COULD have been sticky, as the 3 Special Knees players were no stumps, and of the 2 Nomads players, they pulled Rich, who has always been a thorn in our side, both with goalscoring and whinging....

The difference between the previous game and this game was huge. The movement was great, the passing was great, the tackling was great, and we opened up a 4 goal lead in the opening 15 mins from Paddy, Jason (2) and myself (after a mazy dribble where everyone fell for my 'one trick' and with the goal in front of me, I slotted home....it felt pretty good) - and even though Rich got enough space to get a shot off to make it 4-1, we were very confident at half time.

The second half began with Max putting away a fine goal (relieving the frustration as he'd missed a couple of opportunities in the first half) and Lou followed up with a 6th, bundling the ball home. Max belted a 7th from the penalty spot and I got a straightforward 8th, either side of a Special Knees consolation, again from Rich, and the Padd-meister finished the scoring that he'd begun with the 9th.

FT: BeDazzled 9-2 Special Knees

Squad: Dean (GK), Louis, Phil, Max, Paddy, Jason

All in all, a superb performance and enough to clinch that coveted (*cough*) 3rd spot. Is this our best ever finish? Well, we had a terrific 3rd place when it was 8 teams per division, during the Magnus/Dom/Rich/Nathan/etc era, which was 11th out of 16 over the 2 divisions - we also finished 8th out of 12 during the single season that there was just one big division, which was also quite an achievement - so we're not in uncharted territory, but given we had to cope with the loss of the legend of Kenny in net (even if he made a few cameos), it's a pretty damned good outcome, even if we had loftier ambitions just a week or two earlier.

Stats? I've got a new laptop and I had some time a few weeks back to try and get the stats up to date - reverse engineering texts from Kenninho or Catninho or Paddinho as to the goalscorers and the order of the goals was quite a task - and even worse was the weeks when I was there, and naively believed I'd be able to remember the goalscorers - I admit that a couple of games from last season are likely to be completely incorrect, but I'm in charge, so BITE ME.

This season....

Appearances:

Goalie Appearance Stats
      7 Dean
      3 Rob

Outfield Appearance Stats
     10 Paddy
      9 Max
      8 Chris
      6 Phil
      5 Ross
      5 Louis
      3 Dean
      1 McRob
      1 Jason

Firstly - huge debt of thanks to the Mighty McRob and Jason for stepping in in our hour of need - McRob has dug us out of a hole a few times, and worked tirelessly - of course he stepped in when I was throwing up on the sidelines and helped us out in tough circumstances, and it's a shame he walked into such a mess, against a rampant opponent - his endless running was a credit, obviously. Jason was a terrific addition in the final game - and his goals in the first half helped massively in getting those final 3 points

A full house of 10 straight games for Paddy and Dean - ever dependable - with Max on their heels. A HUGELY welcome return to fitness for Chris - the first half in particular showed what a (mostly) fit Chris can bring to the team - hampered in the second half with his ribs, but nonetheless, something to build on - Ross and Lou performing ever dependably when available - we'll be bolstered by the return of the BeDazzled original Donal as he returns from 6+ months in South America - he's been looking svelte on his Facebook photos, so if his touch hasn't left him (and maybe he's picked up some Samba Skills), we'll be strong next season.

So who was top scorer??? I *think* I've got the scorers nailed for this season (even if last season is ropey) so.....DRUM ROLL!

Top Goalscorers
     14 Max
     13 Paddy
      4 Phil
      3 Chris
      2 Ross
      2 Louis
      2 Jason
      1 OG
      1 Dean

And it's MAX! His second half brace in the final game keeping him on top....but no doubt he'll say "but it's not about personal stats, Phil...." ;)

Respect to Jason on the goals-per-appearance victory, and respect to Dean for notching despite spending most of the season between the sticks (and in defence when outfield) - he's managed to tie with Thor from Irons who belted home a stupendous OG, so well done to both of them for coming bottom!

This time next week, we'll be back on the pitch. I look forward to leading you to BeDazzled glory!
