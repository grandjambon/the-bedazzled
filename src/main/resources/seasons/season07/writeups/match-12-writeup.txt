Fellow BeDazzled,

After being outplayed the previous week by a promotion contender, we faced another team with promotion aspirations this week in Boot Tang Clan (nee Tropa) - we faced BTC earlier in the season and despite facing up against a 5 man team with no proper goalkeeper, we ended up receiving a lesson in ball retention as BTC broke a 2-2 tie midway through the second half and picked us off for the rest of the game in a hugely professional (and impressive) performance.

The evening started well - I had been roped into playing for the Dazzlers as they had only 4 men available, and we held off Bayern Bru for a 6-3 victory to continue the Dazzlers' extremely strong recent run, even giving them a good shot of a 3rd and possibly even 2nd in the top flight - it's been clear for a good few weeks that they won't be joining us back in the second tier. And after Special Knees saw off Fullback, our game arrived. We had a 6 man squad, with Nathan and Dominik returning to the squad to give us the extra running, in place of Rich (recurrence of his ankle problem) and Magnus, while I was available in the event that we had injury problems. As well as having our fittest and best runners available, we were also boosted by a fantastic pair of Nike Astroturf Trainers being sported by Paddy, and for the opening few minutes, those boots were unquestionably giving Paddy the edge in both touch and grip on a slightly slippery surface.

Ahead of the game, the tactics were to try and track their movement, however midway through the first half, we failed to pick them up - and we were a goal down. However, with Paddy driving us forward and Nathan covering the back, we came back into the game, and after a ball hopped up in front of their defender in his own area, he lifted his arm, and once it hit him, the ref pointed immediately to the spot for a penalty. Paddy took the ball, however the magic boots weren't able to lift the BeDazzled curse on penalty taking, and he could only put it wide. A second BTC goal followed shortly after, as Kenny was unsighted as the shot came in and the relatively soft shot nestled in the bottom corner. While a lesser team would think that tonight was not going to be the night, the BeDazzled showed that they're made of tougher stuff. Before half time, Louis wriggled in from the right hand side, and swung his foot through the ball into the bottom corner to bring us back into the game at 2-1, which was how we went in at the break.

We were certainly buoyed by that goal before half time, and early in the second half, Dean brought us level, taking advantage of some slack play at the back by BTC - and as our confidence grew, we started to really take a stranglehold of the game. With BTC getting more and more frustrated, this showed up in a few small incidents, but we clearly showed that we'd learned from the D&D fiasco a few weeks back, but not getting involved with anything - Nathan indeed knowing perfectly how to get under the skin of the opponent, while keeping completely cool when his opponent's mouth started to flap. We took a deserved lead shortly after, with Dean punishing more slackness at the back. 

BTC tried to muster a response, but they found the BeDazzled in top form - Lou and Dom were putting them under constant pressure in midfield, and Dean was holding the ball up superbly whenever called upon, and Kenny was a safe pair of hands on the odd occasions they did break through. There was one moment at 3-2 where I genuinely couldn't see how they weren't going to equalise - however, with Kenny stranded, Paddy was on hand to bolster the backline, and get the key block before clearing up field. That would be the closest BTC would get for the rest of the game.

After breaking up another BTC attack, the ball was sent through to Louis, who was furthest forward - he raced forward, and while he's famous for missing the easiest chances, he showed once more that the toughest chances will go into the back of the net, as he slotted calmly past the goalie. All that was left from here was for Dominik to draw another foul in the far corner, and from that freekick, Dean muscled his way into the area, and capped off a quite brilliant performance by slotting home for his hattrick.

A brilliant, brilliant team performance - not just that we had to pull ourselves out of a 0-2 hole, but that over the 40 minutes, we were much the better team, with grit and determination being combined with using our brains. Was it the greatest BeDazzled performance ever? We were wondering after the game, however, it's tough to look past the 4-4 draw in the Dazzler derby last season as a more gritty performance against top quality opposition. Whatever, though, it was a genuinely magnificent night for the team.

In terms of the league table, we still sit 6th, however, we're just a point behind Unathletic Palermo, though D&D in 4th place might be a little too far away, 4 points ahead of us. However, provided we take full revenge on AC EWF for the horrible 2-0 defeat earlier in the year, we might be looking at a decent final position. The defeat cost BTC ground in the promotion race, and they're just a point ahead of Shillelagh for second spot - Special Knees will need just one more win out of their final two games to be guaranteed top flight football again next season (and in all honesty, they have a 10 goal difference lead on Shillelagh, and so should clinch promotion with a single point). They also face AC EWF in the final game when they should seal promotion whatever happens in the crunch game with BTC next week (which might be worth hanging around for)

And after a Dazzler win, a first ever BeDazzled victory over Tropa/BTC, we had only one thing on our mind for the rest of the evening, taking home 1st prize in the World's End quiz. Even though we arrived midway through the second round, the quizmaster was able to fill us in on the questions we'd missed, and despite being unable to tell apart Pete Doherty and Cherie Blair in the picture round (it actually turned out to be former Cabinet minister Ruth Kelly) we rode Dominik's exceptional knowledge of Apollo space missions to complete the perfect evening as World's End quiz champions. With a 7:45 kickoff this week against AC EWF, we should be able to squeeze in a go at defending our title.

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
