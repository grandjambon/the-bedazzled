Fellow BeDazzled,

Thursday brought the re-arranged fixture with long term adversaries, Boot Tang Clan (aka Tropa de Elite) - BTC/TdE have been bouncing up and and down for the entire time that The BeDazzled have existed, and over those 6 seasons have had 3 promotions and 3 relegations, so they would be a serious test of our promotion credentials.

The squad we had on the night was weakened by the unavailability of Chris (partying in Vancouver) and Max (ankle injury picked up on Tuesday) so we entered the game with a 6 man teamsheet, and missing the endless workrate and commitment of Chris and top (by a mile) scorer, Max. We lined up with Nathan and I covering the back, with Lou/Paddy/Dean in the more advanced roles - our opponents had only 5 men, and no recognised goalkeeper, however that would at least allow them to rotate and rest outfielders.  

We started off like we have in almost all our games recently, like a greyhound. We certainly were on top for the opening 5-10 minutes, and it was against the run of play that we went behind - Nathan got a slight touch on a shot that came back off the post, only to hit Rob's trailing leg as he lay on the ground after diving to try and make the save - the resulting rebound caused it to trickle back over the line. We responded superbly to this set back, and within minutes, we were level - and as Nathan crossed to Paddy, a defender could do nothing but get a touch and put it past his own goalie. 1-1.

The remainder of the half remained tight, but as half-time drew closer, BTC got a free kick on the edge of the box, and as we dallied in getting prepared for the freekick, they played a quick free kick to a man in space, who drilled it past Rob for the lead at the midway point.

We weren't unhappy at halftime, particularly thinking we should have a chance with us having a sub being able to keep us fresh while they would have no respite except in goal. Possibly with one eye on this, BTC played the second half keen on retaining their odd goal lead, and played a possession football that we were finding tricky to disrupt - we were forcing the odd mistake, however, and approaching the midway in the half, we forced a turnover, and given his opportunity, Paddy made absolutely no mistake for 2-2. The key would now be to keep it tight for a period and see if we could force more mistakes - however BTC decided to push on and see if we could withstand some pressure - within a few minutes, they engineered a situation on the edge of the box, and as I moved into block the shot, the ball scuffed off the back of my leg and past Rob for 3-2 - we would have to look for the equaliser again. They returned to their (admittedly, impressive) possession game, and we were having a hard time with this, and finding ourselves turning the ball over cheaply when we really needed to use our limited possession as well as possible - with one eye on this, us having forced a throw-in deep in their half, I moved around the back to offer an outlet for the throw - however, as the ball came out to me, keen to put my foot on the ball and find a white shirt, I overbalanced as I tried to control, under pressure from a BTC player, and turned the ball over badly. Unable to get back quickly enough, I was punished by the striker placing it past Rob - I'm in a frustrating spell at the moment where my mistakes are turning into goals conceded, and this was definitely a costly goal, as it put them in the driving seat with not long to go. They continued to make the ball do the work, with excellent passing, and as we tried to force mistakes, they opened us up a couple more times (including a goal out of nothing from an incredible angle) and with just my shot from distance (which moved in the air sufficiently to deceive the goalie) to show from ourside, we wound up 7-3 losers.

We need to learn from BTC's second half performance - there's no question that they had the right tactics once they opened up a lead, even if on one occasion we managed to pull it level, and once they got 2 goals clear, the asked us big questions that we couldn't answer. While The BeDazzled is built very much on workrate, marking and organisation, we do to get better at our usage of the ball - BTC looked for the spare man all night, and their first touches were excellent. It was no disgrace to lose the game, by any stretch, and we matched them for 2/3 of the game, but they really stretched us as the game went on, and we had almost no chances in the final 1/3 of the game, a sort of strangulation of the game that we appear unable to manage....but anyway. We move on, and will have a chance of revenge in a couple weeks.

AC EWF this week - they're regular whipping boys of the division, but they've won a game this year (against BTC, if I recall correctly?) so we have to take them very seriously.

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
