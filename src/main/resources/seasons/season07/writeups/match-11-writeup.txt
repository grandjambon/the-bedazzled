Fellow BeDazzled,

We've spent a few weeks a bit on the up and down, with excellent wins over Unathletic and Fullback flanking a crap defeat by D&D, so we went into the game against Special Knees looking to win back-to-back games for the first time in what seems like forever.

Special Knees are no pushovers however, mixing strength and quality in a squad that lead the league at the half way stage with 6 wins and 1 draw. The draw? Well, that was against us, a 5-5 draw that came close to boiling over, and where a magnificent first half performance (5-1 HT lead) was followed by something of a collapse to give us just a point. I had reason to believe that we had a good chance with Magnus being available for this game, being as he has always matched up extremely well with their antipodean front man Toby in the strength department. We would also have to deal with their other danger man Angelo, an Italian with no specific trick, but fine touch and the ability to effortlessly ghost past you and bring other players into the game.

This was where the plan hit the rocks, however - while I'm pretty up to speed with the regular players of almost all the teams in this division, I haven't seen much of Special Knees this year, outside of the game that we played against them, and when they lined up on Thursday, Toby was missing, however, someone I didn't recognise start off up front - he was shorter, but had shoulders to compare to Magnus, and in the opening minutes, we realised had tricks too, as a couple of flicks and backheels came off to create space where there appeared to be none, and as we failed to pick up the rest of the team, we found ourselves 2-0 before we'd really had any kind of possession.

As is often the way players at our level, players who beat you all ends up with a trick don't end up doing so for long, as once you've seen it a few times, you generally work out how to deal with it, and we did settle into the game, even creating a couple of chances, even if we weren't flowing quite as we have done recently. We were also hampered a little by the fact that Rich and Magnus were both in the team, and having scarcely played in 6-12 months, there were a number of miscommunications throughout the team, from players appearing in the same position to players not shouting and leaving the ball to each other - this isn't unexpected, and as both players come back more regularly, the gelling should return as players play together, and gradually we'll play better as a team. Also, to be expected on a night when Dominik and Nathan are missing, we weren't able to cover half as much ground as we might when they're on the pitch - it's been noted many times around the team that you REALLY notice when both of those players are missing. Lou was at least able to make up for some of that running, but however well he's played recently, he wasn't quite able to make up for the lack of the other two.

So while we recovered in the second quarter of the game, we went in 3-0 down as we were unable to pull one back, and just before the break, we gave ourselves a mountain to climb when Angelo picked up a ball that was intended for the running Paddy, and with a huge gap behind him, the little Italian strode forward and effortlessly stroked the ball past Kenny for the third.

The second half continued the theme of the lead up to half time - Magnus was involved in a tussle of strength against the tricky new guy, one in which was perhaps he was culpable of a few holding fouls ;) and where possible, we managed to get a few decent shots on goal - Paddy worked superbly to cut one back to me and as my first time volley headed to the top corner, their goalie just got a fist to knock it wide, Rich hit the post, and we couldn't eat into their lead. Meanwhile, at the other end, despite Magnus's best attempts to hold back their striker, he managed backheel the ball back through Magnus's legs and wriggle free, and despite it initially looking like an awkward move, he opened up his body beautifully to put it past Kenny into the far corner with a sidefoot shot. A particularly good goal to put them 4-0 up.

We finally got the goal we deserved when Paddy knocked one home for 4-1, and that's how it finished. Hard to say that it was anything other than a deserved win for Special Knees, as they started better than us (it's rare that a team puts us on the backfoot so quickly, normally we take the lead) and when they put us under concerted pressure, they got the goals, punishing any slackness. They look very good bets for promotion again, after a season back in the second division.

Things won't be any easier next week, as we face Boot Tang Clan (aka Tropa), who were top of the league last time I looked, having finally overhauled Special Knees at the top. Though our exceptional depth might help us this week, as the usual struggle to field a team on the night before Good Friday shouldn't affect us this year, as a quick straw poll on Thursday suggested that most players will be available. Hopefully, our opponents won't be so well covered for the game.

One final note - I have registered the web domain of the-bedazzled.com - the mailing lists are set up, and "watch this space" for the website. Provided I get a few spare hours this weekend, I will hope to get it up and running, at least with a simple page containing the fixtures and stats and links to the All Nations site. There's even a team photo. It's not pretty.

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
