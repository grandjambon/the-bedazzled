BeDazzled,

We approached Thursday's fixture in confident mood - the revitalised BeDazzled squad was chomping at the bit following week 1's terrific win over Unathletic Palermo, however, we all knew that facing bogey team Dumb & Dumbarton would be a genuine test of our newly found confidence. We've faced D&D every season since we joined the league, along with ourselves and AC EWF, the only teams not to have been promoted during the 6 seasons we've been with All-Nations - and while we've largely owned AC EWF, D&D have given us a torrid time. In the 12 fixtures, we're W2 D2 L8 - and even when we've played well they've seemed to get enough luck to get past us. The two draws in particular, were games we utterly dominated, and somehow managed to snatch a draw from the jaws of victory in each case. Magnus in particular still has nightmares about his last minute penalty in one of the 3-3 draws which the goalie clawed away.

It was another strong squad, with Donal making his first appearance of the season in place of the rotated Paddy as part of the front 3, and myself coming in for the rotated Dominik in the back 3. Chris, Nathan, Dean and Max rounded out the outfield, along with Rob in net. This was also Donal's return to fulltime BeDazzled action, having spent most of the Summer/Autumn as my captain and leader for Inter Me Nan in the 7 a side league in Southwark. D&D were also at full strength, after missing a number of regulars last week, and receiving a thumping at the hands of Fullback.

The first half was a continuation of last week - other than an early scare where tricky D&D striker Tony hammered the crossbar from the left hand side, we took the game to D&D, and with Max working his usual magic scoring a hattrick we went into the break 3-0 up. The shape was superb, with Nathan in particular hoovering everything up, and Donal showing absolutely no rustiness on his return to the smaller pitch, and Rob was scarcely called upon during the opening half due to us getting up and down the pitch to make challenges. The halftime teamtalk was "more of the same", though D&D came out in the second half in no mood to let us have it all our own way for second half.

D&D fought doggedly in the second half, and while the first 10 minutes didn't change the scoreline, we eventually conceded our first goal of the season as thir lanky but extremely skillful midfielder Dan broke through, and after hitting the outside of the post reacted quickest with Rob prostrate and stuck away thr rebound to make it 3-1. Rob was then called upon to make further saves before a controversial play-on (I didn't see anything myself, but Max was pretty convinced) lead to D&D breaking to make it 3-2 with 5 mins left. The game had become VERY stretched by this point, and we had lost our shape a little. 

However, stung by our dwindling lead, we reacted instantly - Max played a neat 1-2 with Donal, and buried it to give us back our 2 goal cushion, and with just a couple of minutes remaining, surely seal the 3 points. Ugh. D&D don't give up, and this week was no different - they quickly got it back to 4-3, and with no more than a minute they were on top of us again. At this point, I managed to win the ball back, and brought it up the right flank - with Donal starting to move, my brain told me I needed to slide him through where he'd be one-on-one with the keeper, surely sealing the points at this late stage. What happened in reality was that I underhit my pass, which was intercepted by D&D's Dan who took it down the line and crossed to an unmarked Tony for 4-4 with the last kick of the game. As I looked for the ground to open up, it didn't, and all I could do was to put my hand up and take the blame for that one.

FT: BeDazzled 4-4 Dumb & Dumbarton

Of course, we had been collectively sloppy in the second half, and when the game became stretched, we were rushing around and getting annoyed with our opponents and losing our heads when we needed to be calmer. We may be the New BeDazzled, but the Old BeDazzled had a real difficulty in holding leads that we'd worked so hard to gain, and this is something we appear unable to shake off easily. The last 4 games have seen us in the lead with literally minutes to go, and we only managed to close out one of the games, drawing the other two. The positive is that we were in position to win all those games right up to the end, and 3 of those games were against VERY strong opposition, however, if we can keep cooler in those positions and keep our positions, we should be able to turn those into wins. 

But we also have to look at the "work in progress" that we are at the moment and there were a number of occasions where 2 players would go to the same ball, and end up leaving it to each other - this is all part of gelling as a team, and with Chris/Nathan effectively 'new signings' to go along with Max only having played 4 or 5 times for the team previously (amusingly, he and Donal partnered each other for spells in the first half, despite not having been formally introduced as Donal arrived as we were kicking off....) - so this will all improve as we have a settled squad and well defined responsibilities.

The next fixture is a TOUGH one. Fullback. They were a Jekyll and Hyde team last season - they absolutely destroyed us in both fixtures, the first when we probably underestimated them and they tanked us (Paddy's comment coming off the pitch being "you really see the difference when we have neither Dom or Nathan in the team and how much ground they each must cover"), the second when we certainly didn't underestimate them, and fought tooth and nail however they put on quite a display of finishing, particularly one lad who I'd scarcely seen before, who routinely pushed it to wide positions and utterly spanked home from a near impossible angle. However, I saw them on a number of occasions turn up with just 5 men and get beaten. They finished 5th or 6th, if I remember correctly, but had one of the better goal differences in the division, which is always a sign to me that a team were better than their actual league position.

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
