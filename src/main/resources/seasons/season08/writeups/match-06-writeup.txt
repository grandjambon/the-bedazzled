Fellow BeDazzled,

After 4 very tough fixtures, we had a chance to right the ship after 3 narrow defeats with a game against perennial strugglers AC Earth Wind Fire. This is not to say we should take any fixture against these gents lightly - we came unstuck against them last season in a game when we probably just assumed we'd take 3 points.

The team was more balanced than recent weeks, though Nathan had again been called over to Newport at short notice on the Wednesday, so we lost his engine - however, this was immediately remedied by abandoning our plan to put Dean in net (apparently this is his best position - and with Rob being in NY for the week, it seemed like a good time to see what he could do) and putting him back outfield, and bringing Damo across from the Dazzlers for the night.

The first half was all BeDazzled - though we didn't go into half time with a scoreline that was representative of the play - firstly Max put away a couple of great goals (one of which coming from a quick throwout from Damo, which Max ran onto down the wing, and dispatched with a venomous shot across the goalie into the far top corner), but with their first real chance of the match, AC took advantage of the defence switching off momentarily, and pulled themselves back into the game. We continued to take the game to AC, and after Paddy belted home the rebound from his own original shot and Max completed a deserved hat-trick to make it 4-1, a piece of magic (which may or may not have been what he intended) from the AC striker allowed him to clip the ball around Chris and as it sat up nicely he ripped home, giving Damo no chance.

A 4-2 lead looks similar to 4-1, but when you concede that goal just before half time, it never feels good. The second half was less one sided, and for a spell we were under the cosh slightly - AC pulled it back to 4-3, and it was squeaky bum time again - we got ourselves back into the game, but we couldn't find any way past their goalie, and knew that slip could find us on level pegging. Fortunately, with a couple of minutes to go, Max drove down the left side and pulled a ball back across goal - for a split second I was disappointed as there was nobody attacking the goal, however an unlucky defender found himself with nothing he could do other than to put the ball into the net, and victory was finally sealed.

Not a classic performance, but it was a win, and after a couple of narrow defeats against very good teams, all that was important was to get back to winning ways, and set ourselves up for a huge game against Fullback. The table couldn't be tighter, with 3 teams on 9 points (ourselves included) and 2 teams on 6 - so from our lofty perch of 3rd place, courtesy of our better goal difference, we could easily drop a number of spots with a bad result tonight. Fullback are a Jekyll and Hyde team - we've received a couple of thumpings from them, while we've beaten them comfortably many times. 

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
