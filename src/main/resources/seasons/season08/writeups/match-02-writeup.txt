Fellow BeDazzled,

Last season, we began superbly with victory and a clean sheet over Unathletic Palermo, and followed up with a tricky game against D&D - in that game, we were 3-0 up at half time, having dominated the opening 20 and had gone a game and a half into the new season without conceding a goal - we then contrived to throw it away and give up a last minute equaliser, and didn't win another game until the second half of the season.

This season, we began superbly with victory and a clean sheet over Unathletic Palermo, and followed up with a tricky game against D&D - in that game, we were 1-0 up at half time, having dominated the opening 20, and had gone a game and a half into the new season without conceding a goal - all sounding familiar?

We had another strong squad for Thursday, though with Chris Catney's comeback delayed due to the ankle not holding up to a late fitness test, and Nathan stuck in traffic after another big journey back from Newport, we ended up with a 6 man squad - the changes from the previous week being Donal effectively taking Nathan's role at the back, and Max being a straight swap for Rich.

As you all know, D&D have been a team who've had a hex over us from day one - they were our first ever opponents, and while we have beaten them a few times, they've always managed to force us to give every ounce of effort, somehow managing to get points even in games when we've had them pegged back for the entire game. They also always appeared to have their first choice players out every time we play them, yet have put out some dreadful teams when I've seen them play other teams. Tonight, however, they had 6 men, but their most dangerous and skilful players were absent as they lined up.

The first half played like it was a continuation of last week - good movement, good passing and a wall at the back - after a couple of chances went begging, we made the breakthrough, as a looping lobbed pass from wide found Max in space and he made no mistake. We proceeded to take the game to D&D for the rest of the half, though their goalkeeper was keeping them in it, and we were only a goal to the good at half time.

As I stood on the sidelines, I was obviously delighted with the performance, but there was that nagging fear that we'd live to regret the fact that we couldn't open up any sort of daylight. However, we are getting better and better and are showing much more ability to close the games out at the moment, and we were certainly confident at the break.

The second half was predictably much tighter, and the game gained a more physical edge - last season's second encounter brought 3 yellow cards (2 for D&D, 1 for us) and my teamtalk had been all about keeping cool heads, and despite some heavy tackles (not to mention some clear fouls - Ali got all the key decisions right, in my opinion) there was absolutely no reaction from any of the BeDazzled, which I'm extremely pleased with. We Are The BeDazzled - We Don't Get Involved.

Our reward was 3 points and another clean sheet - though it wasn't entirely plain sailing - there was one moment when D&D got behind us, and after Rob pulled off one save, it fell back to their striker, and when it looked like he was certain to slot home, Kenny somehow got a leg to his shot and put it over. It wasn't vintage in front of goal, however, we fully deserved the win. While we had great performances throughout the team (as usual), Paddy deserves particular recognition for the amount of ground he covered throughout - combined with his new boots, he's a force to be reckoned with at the moment.

BeDazzled v Dumb & Dumbarton

	1-0    (Max)

HT: BeDazzled 1-0 Dumb & Dumbarton

FT: BeDazzled 1-0 Dumb & Dumbarton

Squad: Rob (GK), Donal, Dominik, Dean, Paddy, Max

So - back to back wins to start the season - and back to back clean sheets too. The big games keep coming too - next week we face Shillelagh, who I would suggest are probably the team to beat in this season's competition. They won't lie down and roll over, so we will have to be at our strongest as we try to pick them off. We only have a single point to show for many tussles, with leads having been thrown away late on to go with some more clear victories. We only faced them 2 weeks ago in the final game of last season, and lack of depth was the only thing that prevented us from holding onto a second half 2 goal lead.

I'm also waiting the table to confirm what I HOPE is true, that we're top for the second straight week. Our +10 goal difference from 2 games should be enough to keep us there. Maybe other teams are looking at us thinking WE'RE the team to beat?

GO GO GO BEDAZZLED!
