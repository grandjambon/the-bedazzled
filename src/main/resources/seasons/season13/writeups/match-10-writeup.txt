BeDazzled Brothers,

The season drew to a close last week - and with 3rd place guaranteed, and the promotion spots already decided, we finished off the season with a comfortable 6-4 win over Special Knees - the only real point of note being the golden boot....? With Donal not playing, he was out of the picture, and Paddy and Max level on 12 each, it was going to be a shootout....

This left a final goalscoring total of:

Top Goalscorers
     14 Paddy
     14 Max
      9 Donal
      4 Ross
      2 Dean
      2 Chris
      1 Phil

A share for the golden boot - and with Donal also chipping in with a fine haul, it was a pretty good goalscoring season.

Now, while the B Grade didn't have much in the way of final day tension, this was in stark contrast to the A Grade, where the night started with 6 points separating the top and bottom, 4 teams of the 6 teams with a mathematical chance of going down, including one team (St Peter's) who was arguably favourite for the title, and another team (Circus) who were safe from relegation, but in with a chance of winning the league with a negative goal difference. Crazy times.

Team 			P 	W 	D 	L 	F 	A 	GD 	PTS
Nomads 			9 	5 	1 	3 	49 	45 	4 	16
Circus FC		9	5	1	3	32	36	-4	16
St Peters Immaculata	9	4	1	4	45	33	12	13
Irons			9	4	1	4	53	51	2	13
Bobby’s Dazzlers	9	3	1	5	45	48	-3	10
Nice Tackle		9	3	1	5	36	48	-12	10

Firstly, Irons faced Nice Tackle knowing a point would relegate both the Dazzlers and Nice Tackle, Dazzlers faced Circus hoping to still be alive, and if Circus lost to the Dazzlers, the final game would pit Nomads against St Peter's in a "winner takes all, and Nomads if it's a draw"final game.

Irons didn't prepare well for their game - only 4 men showed up, and testament to their ability, they only lost 7-5 despite being a man short the whole game. This kept the Dazzlers alive for their game, and despite Circus looking to put one hand on the title trophy, Dazzlers TORE into Circus looking to get the 4 goal win that they needed to relegate Irons. It looked good early on with Dazzler Will rattling home a pair to give them a 2-0 half time lead - they had missed a host of chances, however, and this continued into the second half with wave after wave of Dazzler attacks hitting woodwork or sliding wide when it looked like it was in - Circus looked like they were going to make a game of it when they pulled it back to 2-1, but Adam and Will belted home a pair with a few mins left to bring the Dazzlers a goal away from staying up. However, despite creating more chances (with myself, Chris and Dean hollering support on the sidelines) the final whistle went, and the Dazzlers were relegated on GOALS SCORED. Incredible stuff.

This left the small matter of Nomads v Circus for the league, with Nomads needing just a point. They lined up without their Spanish playmaker, and the smart money was on St Peter's to pull off an incredible turnaround having been in the relegation zone most of the season. St Peter's raced off to a 2-0 half time lead, and had one hand on the trophy, before Nomads pulled back to equalise in the second half. With just minutes to go, however, St Peter's took the lead, and the league was theirs in an incredible finish to the season. 

Team			P	W	D	L	F	A	GD	PTS
St Peters Immaculata	10	5	1	4	48	35	13	16
Nomads			10	5	1	4	52	48	4	16
Circus FC		10	5	1	4	33	40	-7	16
Irons			10	4	1	5	58	58	0	13
Bobby’s Dazzlers	10	4	1	5	49	49	0	13
Nice Tackle		10	4	1	5	43	53	-10	13

Yes, you're right. That is just 3 points separating first and last. The Dazzlers were relegated with a goal difference of 0, and Circus narrowly missed out on the title with a negative goal difference. 

So next season - the Dazzler Derby is back. And it's back THIS THURSDAY. They preview pack should be out shortly....
